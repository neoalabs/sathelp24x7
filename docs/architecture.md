# SATHELP24x7 Architecture

## Overview

SATHELP24x7 is built as a modern web application with a clear separation between frontend and backend components. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and optimized for AI-powered educational experiences.

## System Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js (with Vite as build tool)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Visualization**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with secure storage

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (async)
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth2
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Gemini Pro for chat, essay feedback, and question generation
  - LangChain for orchestration and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for semantic search and memory
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

### Deployment

- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Database**: PostgreSQL container
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI container
- **Frontend**: Served via static files or dedicated Node container

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Frontend collects credentials
   - Backend validates and issues JWT token
   - Token stored in localStorage and used for subsequent requests

2. **AI Chat Flow**:
   - User sends message via frontend
   - Backend enriches with context from Pinecone
   - Gemini API generates response
   - Response stored in vector database for future context
   - Response displayed to user

3. **Quiz System**:
   - Quizzes either pre-generated or dynamically created via Gemini
   - User answers tracked in PostgreSQL
   - Performance analysis computed in backend
   - Results visualized in frontend

4. **Essay Feedback**:
   - User submits essay content
   - Backend sends to Gemini with specific prompt template
   - Structured feedback returned to user
   - Essays and feedback stored for historical reference

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Secure JWT implementation with proper expiration
- **API Security**: CORS configuration, rate limiting
- **Data Protection**: Sanitization of user inputs
- **AI Safety**: Prompt engineering to prevent misuse

## Scalability

- **Database**: Connection pooling, async operations
- **API**: Stateless design allowing horizontal scaling
- **AI Services**: Caching common responses, batching requests
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone scales independently

## Development Workflow

1. Local development with docker-compose
2. Testing with pytest (backend) and Jest (frontend)
3. CI/CD via GitHub Actions
4. Deployment to production environment
